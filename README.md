# Picross-Solver
Python program that uses recursive backtracking to solve any picross problem. The picross board can be set to any size and any valid rules can be used for the rows and columns, as long as the input file is in the right format.  
The first line of the input text file has two integer values, the height and width respectively, separated by a space. The next lines (specifically the number of lines equal to the height) are the rules for each row from top to bottom, which are integers separated by a space. The next number of lines equal to the width are each for the rules of each column from left to right.

# Technologies
Python 3.8.5  
Matplotlib 3.4.1  
Numpy 1.19.2

# Launch
Set the input text file to the name of the file read in the solver.py program, and then simply run solver.py.
